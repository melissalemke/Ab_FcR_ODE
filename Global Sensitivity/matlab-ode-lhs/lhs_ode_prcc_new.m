%% Calculate PRCCs and their significances
%%
%% Inputs:
%%
%% N is the number of runs
%%
%% k is the number of varied parameters, initial conditions.
%%
%% LHSmatrix: LHS matrix (N x k)
%%            The k varied parameter and varied initial condition values for
%%            each of N runs.
%%
%%            LHSmatrix(:,i) are the values for varied parameter/initial
%%            condition i for the N runs.
%%
%% Y: output matrix (time x N), where time is the number of time points the
%%    model was solved for.
%%
%% s: time points to test (row vector)
%%    This is indices into a time span.
%%    If s(i) = l then that means use the lth time point.
%%
%% Outputs:
%%
%% prcc: The prcc values, length(s) x k (time points tested x # of varied
%%       items).
%%
%% prcc_significance: The significance (p-values) of the prcc values,
%%                    length(s) x k (time points tested x # of varied items).
